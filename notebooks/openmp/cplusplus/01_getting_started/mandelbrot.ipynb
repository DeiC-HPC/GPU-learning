    "Getting started\n",
    "===============\n",
    "In this part we are going to show you how to run a program on a GPU, this is\n",
    "done using an example program, which is converted in a few steps to run on the\n",
    "GPU. The example program we are going to look at calculates the Mandelbrot set.\n",
    "\n",
    "0 Sequential implementation\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "The sequential version contains a function called `mandelbrot`, which is all the\n",
    "logic we need to calculate the Mandelbrot set.\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "int mandelbrot(complex<float> z, int maxiterations) {\n",
    "    complex<float> c = z;\n",
    "    for (int i = 0; i < maxiterations; i++) {\n",
    "        if (abs(z) > 2) {\n",
    "            return i;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        z = z*z + c;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    return maxiterations;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "It takes a complex number `z` and a maximum number of iterations to be run.\n",
    "\n",
    "To setup the function we have a lot of variables with default values defining\n",
    "width and height of the image we are generating, how many iterations should at\n",
    "most be run in the `mandelbrot` function, and which area of the fractal should\n",
    "be shown (default is everything).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we have two nested loops creating a complex number in the range of the\n",
    "minimum and maximum values and then calculating the mandelbrot function for each\n",
    "of these numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is then written to disk so we can visualize it and see the mandelbrot.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Before we start\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "Before we start converting the program to run on GPUs with OpenMP, we need to lay\n",
    "some groundwork. We need to understand how to make the program run on the GPU and\n",
    "how to get our data to and from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenMP is a set of pragmas, which the compiler uses to optimize your code. These\n",
    "pragmas start with `#pragma omp` where `omp` is the start of the OpenMP\n",
    "statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that you mostly write your programs as you normally do but with some\n",
    "exceptions as we need to make it work on the GPU as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When compiling there are several available options, but in this tutorial we will\n",
    "focus on GCC.\n",
    "\n",
    "In GCC you add the flag `-fopenmp` when you want the compiler to understand the\n",
    "OpenMP pragmas. When you compile for the GPU then you will also need to use\n",
    "`-fno-stack-protector` as these checks will not work and cause the program to\n",
    "crash. If you use any math libraries then you will also need to add\n",
    "`-foffload=-lm`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using CUDA 11 then you also have to add `-foffload=\"-misa=sm_35\"` as\n",
    "the default currently is `sm_30`, which has been dropped. Also the only two\n",
    "options are `sm_30` and `sm_35`."
